Language choice
===============

The choice of the language is a crucial one.
Here the alternatives where mainly matlab, C, C++ or Python.

Python was chosen for its many advantages.
Not only is open, it is also widely supported by the scientific community. The Python community is very enthusiast and active. In addition, despite being an interpreted language, it is really fast, as the main algorithms are coded using C.

Besides, Python is also used by major libraries. Numpy provides an efficient way to handle big arrays, Scipy adds scientific functions, Joblib enables simple parallel computing and Scikit-learn is a state of the art Machine-Learning library.

Last, many powerful tools are available for this very language, beginning with IPython.

For those reason and for many others, Python was used all along the intership.
